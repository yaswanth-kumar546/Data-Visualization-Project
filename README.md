PROJECT NAME: IRIS DATA VISUALIZATION WITH SEABORN AND MATPLOTLIB

**Iris Dataset Visualization:** 
This project visualizes the famous Iris flower dataset using Seaborn's pairplot, helping to explore relationships between features and distinguish between species.

**What It Does:**
- Loads the Iris dataset from scikit-learn
- Converts it into a Pandas DataFrame
- Adds species labels for clarity
- Generates a pairplot to visualize feature distributions and correlations across species


Why It Matters
The Iris dataset is a classic in machine learning and data visualization. This project demonstrates:
- How to use Seaborn for multivariate visualization
- How KDE plots can reveal feature distributions
- How species differ based on petal and sepal measurements

  
**Requirements:**
The following Python libraries installed:
"pip install pandas seaborn scikit-learn matplotlib"


**How to Run:**
Just run the Python script:
"python iris_pairplot.py"


**This will display a pairplot showing the relationships between:**
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width
Each species is color-coded for easy comparison.



**Dataset Reference:**
- Iris Dataset â€“ UCI Machine Learning Repository
